December 13, 2010 I was thinking the other day about music, as I am very often doing, and I came to an interesting conclusion. Let’s see if I can recreate my thought process so this whole thing
    makes sense. </p><p>The first thought that I had was part of what I always thought was an interesting paradox of my tastes. I have observed that the average person these days has a particular type of music that they particularly like, and that they listen to almost exclusively.
    It very often reflects their character, or at least seems to, and other types of music tend to clash with the person’s sensibilities, and so they find those other types of music to be of lesser quality than their particular favorite. All of this is
    well and good, and there is nothing wrong with having favorite music. The paradox is that I don’t have a favorite type of music. In the course of a month, if someone were to ask me what my favorite type of music was, I would either have 20 different
    answers, or I would list off all of the genres of music, just in a different order each time. I really do like all kinds of music, from classical (including baroque and romantic era and all that) to heavy metal, from country to smooth jazz, and from
    funk to ska. I even like Weird Al Yankovic and rap. I don’t think that I’m absolutely unique in that, but I most certainly do not represent the norm, I don’t think. I don’t like poorly written music, but that’s about all that I don’t like. That was
    my first thought. </p><p>My next thought took me on somewhat of a digression. I was thinking about the two men who contributed the most to contemporary logic, Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Bear with me here, I promise this will make sense. Frege spent much of his career
    creating first order logic, and after 20 years of slaving over it and doing more for logic than anyone else had done, Bertrand Russell discovered a critical problem with one of Frege’s initial premises. It’s known in the logic world as Russell’s Paradox.
    Here is the amazing part. When Russell wrote to Frege and pointed out the problem, Frege responded in a surprisingly classy way. Instead of blowing up and trying to discredit Russell, who was significantly younger than Frege, he immediately recognized
    his mistake and worked to correct it. He was willing to accept that his theories were not perfect, and almost welcomed the criticism. </p><p>Then I got to thinking about logic in general. Aristotle and the Stoics way back in ancient Greece came up with syllogistic logic, and they used that all the way through the middle ages, up until Frege made his considerable advancements. Now, if Aristotle
    were to be brought to our time and see the advancements that have been made in logic, I think that he would be greatly impressed by them. I think that the complexity of the “new” types of logic would fascinate him and he would love to study it and
    learn how to use it. I can hardly imagine Aristotle scoffing at first order logic or set theory. Just because we are more advanced in logic today than he was at his time doesn’t mean that he would be disappointed that we didn’t stick with syllogistic
    logic. In fact, he would be thrilled to see the advancements, I think. </p><p>Now, back to music and the wrap up. I’d never considered the music question in terms of Aristotle and logic before, and so this thought brought new ideas to the table. I began to realize why I like so many different types of music. For centuries, because
    of slower communication and all that jazz, the advancements in music happened globally. That’s why we talk about the classical era, the baroque era, the romantic era, etc. Because they were complete eras of musical thought and complexity. However,
    starting in the 1900’s, with the advent of recording and advances in musical technology, that tendency to globally shift turned into musicians branching off and creating their own styles of music altogether. Now, the number of styles and genres is
    almost as big as the number of musicians. However, just as with the global shifts of previous centuries, each of these genres of music has undergone serious advancement with time, and the complexities of the music have intensified in many of the genres.
    Also, with the advent of different playing styles, there are genres of music that couldn’t have existed any time but now. I like so many types of music now because I see the musical value of each genre. I can trace every band or musician back to Beethoven
    and Bach, and seeing the progress is like watching a classic NBA game from the 60’s right before watching one from the 90’s (I think the NBA has gone downhill since the 90’s. Different story for a different time). Music these days has become much
    more intricate and complex, and I find it fascinating. </p><p>So what do I think Beethoven or Bach would say about contemporary music? I honestly think they would be as fascinated as Frege was, or as Aristotle would be, or as I am. There are so many more levels to music than they were capable of creating today.
    I think they would appreciate that. </p><p>Two footnotes: </p><p>1. There is plenty of crappy music out there today. Don’t think that I don’t recognize that. I think Beethoven and Bach would be the first to agree with me that music has both gotten better and gotten a whole lot worse. </p><p>2. All of this points to another fact. The inability to see that progress in music of all genres these days is the result of one very simple thing: arrogant ignorance</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!--
